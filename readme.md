# Timer (a VueJS app)
In this project we have setup a node server with socket.io to create a timer. 
The timer has 3 functions:
1. Stop the timer
2. Start the timer
3. Reset the timer

## Setup
* Make sure you have the latest node version installed.
* Make sure that NPM works
* Clone the project and run `npm install` in the terminal
* Run the app by executing `node app.js`
* App runs on localhost:8000

## ToDo List
* Create separate files: 1 for css, 2 javascript files (1 VueJS file, 1 serverfile), 1 for html
* Display also milliseconds
* Add unit tests
